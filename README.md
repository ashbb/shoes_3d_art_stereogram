The world of 3D is a mysterious place. :)

Look at the following stereograms created with Shoes!

Can you see a letter `E` ?

**Note:** This snapshot was created with ms-paint on Windows XP. It's a bit twisted. So, please run `lattice_stereogram.rb` with Shoes and look at the stereogram on Shoes window.

Click `new` button. 49 small blue rectangles with 12 random dots will be displayed.

You can move one at a time with mouse.

This is my first original stereogram. The second-top and second-bottom lines are looked like depressed. And there are three dents in the middle.

This is my second shot. After moving some rectangles just a little bit distance, we can see 6 rectangles up and 5 down. Amazing!
